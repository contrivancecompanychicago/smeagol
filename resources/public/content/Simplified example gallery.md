## How this works

The specification for this gallery is as follows:

```
![Frost on a gate, Laurieston](content/uploads/g1.jpg)
![Feathered crystals on snow surface, Taliesin](content/uploads/g2.jpg)
![Feathered snow on log, Taliesin](content/uploads/g3.jpg)
![Crystaline growth on seed head, Taliesin](content/uploads/g4.jpg)
```

That's all there is to it - a sequence of image links just as you'd write them anywhere else in the wiki.

## The Gallery

This page holds another example Photoswipe gallery, this time using a simpler, Markdown-based specification. Processing this specification takes more work than the full syntax used in the other [[Example gallery]], so the gallery may be slower to load; but it's much easier to configure. To see it, <a href="edit?page=Simplified%20example%20gallery">edit this page.</a>
