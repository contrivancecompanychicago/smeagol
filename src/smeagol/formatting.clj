;;;; Right, doing the data visualisation thing is tricky. Doing it in the
;;;; pipeline doesn't work, because the md-to-html-string filter messes up
;;;; both YAML and JSON notation. So we need to extract the visualisation
;;;; fragments from the Markdown text and replace them with tokens we will
;;;; recognise afterwards, perform md-to-html-string, and then replace our
;;;; tokens with the transformed visualisation specification.
